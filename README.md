# Description
Program integrates multiple sensor-driven components with a Raspberry Pi, allowing real-time input processing and actuator control. 

By leveraging an ultrasonic distance sensor, photoresistor-based AD/DA conversion, a servo motor, and an LED, the system dynamically adjusts brightness and movement based on environmental readings.

Users can toggle between two inputs sources: distance measurement and light intensity. Changes are reflected in hardware behaviour.
